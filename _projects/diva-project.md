**Significance:**  
Gender-affirming vaginoplasty is increasingly common, yet little is known about the microbial environment of the surgically constructed neovagina. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common pathology post-vaginoplasty. We compare neovaginal microbial and inflammatory profiles to the cisgender vagina and evaluate clinical symptoms.

**Methods:**  
Structured surveys, Pap smears, and neovaginal swabs have been collected from 36 transfeminine participants. Swabs underwent 16S rRNA sequencing, cytokine profiling, and untargeted metabolomics.

**Results:**  
The neovaginal microbiome is highly diverse and distinct from the cisgender vagina. Healthy cisgender samples are Lactobacillus-dominated, while neovaginal samples have almost no Lactobacillus. Neovaginal communities resemble BV-associated cisgender vagina but contain more Peptoniphilus and Anaerococcus. Vaginal discharge drives elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and metabolite shifts, with unique immune signatures compared to cisgender samples.

**Conclusions:**  
The transfeminine neovagina represents a distinct microbial and immunological niche. High diversity, consistent Lactobacillus depletion, and symptom-associated inflammation highlight the need for neovagina-specific diagnostics and management. Longitudinal studies are necessary to link microbial metabolism, host inflammation, and clinical outcomes.
