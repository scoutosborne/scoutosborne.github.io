# Projects
### Defining the Neovaginal Microbiome
**Abstract:** The transfeminine neovagina represents a distinct microbial and immunological niche. Vaginal discharge strongly correlates with cytokine and metabolite shifts.  
**Methods:** Structured surveys, Pap smears, and neovaginal swabs are collected from 36 transfeminine participants. Swabs undergo 16S rRNA sequencing, cytokine profiling, and untargeted metabolomics.
